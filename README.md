# 📚 AI-Powered Library Book Finder

> Problem Statement No.21 – Library AI Agent
The Challenge – A Library AI Agent is an intelligent system designed to assist students in finding the right learning materials based on their academic needs. It can autonomously analyze user profiles, study topics, and course syllabi to suggest relevant books and resources.
Using natural language processing, it understands student queries and matches them with the most suitable books in the library database.
The agent can check real-time book availability, prioritize high-demand titles, and assist with reservation or waitlist actions.
It saves time by streamlining the search process and offering personalized recommendations aligned with current academic work.
Library AI Agents enhance access, engagement, and resource utilization in educational environments.
> A smart library assistant that uses natural language search to help students find the right books quickly.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional library management systems have significant limitations that affect the student experience:

- **Exact keyword dependency** — Students must know the precise title or author to search for a book. Vague or exploratory queries return no results.
- **No intelligent guidance** — Existing systems do not suggest alternatives, recommend similar books, or account for difficulty level.
- **Poor discoverability** — Students often struggle to find relevant books for a topic, especially when they are beginners and don't know the standard textbook names.
- **No location assistance** — Even after finding a book in the catalog, students have no visual guidance on where it is physically located in the library.

These issues lead to wasted time, frustration, and underutilization of library resources.

---

## 💡 Solution

The **AI-Powered Library Book Finder** addresses these problems by acting as a smart discovery tool:

- **Natural Language Understanding** — Users can type queries like *"I want an easy machine learning book"* or *"beginner Python"* instead of exact titles.
- **Semantic Search Engine** — The system expands queries using synonym mappings and intent detection to find relevant books even without exact keyword matches.
- **Intelligent Ranking** — Books are scored and ranked based on subject relevance, difficulty match, keyword overlap, and availability.
- **Contextual Recommendations** — Each result includes a human-readable reason explaining why it was recommended (e.g., *"Good for beginners — easy to follow"*).
- **Visual Rack Locator** — A library map highlights the physical location of the selected book's rack.

## 🧠 AI / ML Components

This prototype simulates AI-powered search using lightweight, rule-based techniques:

### 1. Semantic Search Engine
- **Synonym Expansion** — Maps related terms (e.g., *"easy"* → *beginner*, *"ML"* → *machine learning*) to broaden query coverage.
- **Multi-field Matching** — Scores are computed across title, subject, keywords, and description fields.

### 2. Intent Extraction
- **`extractQueryIntent()`** — Parses natural language queries to detect:
  - **Subject** (Python, AI, ML, etc.)
  - **Difficulty** (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
  - **Keywords** (filtered from stop words)

### 3. Scoring & Ranking Algorithm
Each book receives a relevance score based on:

| Match Type | Score Weight |
|---|---|
| Title match | +15 per term |
| Subject match | +12 per term |
| Exact keyword match | +10 per keyword |
| Partial keyword match | +5 per keyword |
| Description match | +3 per term |
| Difficulty match | +20 bonus |
| Availability bonus | +2 |

Books are sorted by descending score, and the top results are displayed.

### 4. Reason Generation
- **`getReason()`** — Generates human-readable explanations for each recommendation based on which fields matched (e.g., *"Matches your interest in AI · Short and concise read"*).

### 5. Recommendation System
- Similar books are identified by matching **subject** and **keyword overlap**.
- Results are ranked by a similarity score and displayed in the detail panel.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The system follows a 5-step pipeline for every query:

```
┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│  1. User     │ ──▸ │  2. Intent   │ ──▸ │  3. Score &  │ ──▸ │  4. Display  │ ──▸ │  5. Map      │
│  Enters      │     │  Extraction  │     │  Rank Books  │     │  Results     │     │  Highlights  │
│  Query       │     │              │     │              │     │  + Reasons   │     │  Rack        │
└──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘
```

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **User enters a query** — either via the search bar, suggestion chips, or the AI assistant input.
2. **Intent extraction** — the system parses the query to identify subject, difficulty, and keywords using `extractQueryIntent()`.
3. **Scoring & ranking** — every book in the dataset is scored using `scoreBook()` based on term matches across multiple fields. Results are sorted by descending score.
4. **Results displayed** — matching books appear as cards with relevance scores. The AI assistant also shows human-readable reasons via `getReason()`.
5. **Map highlights rack** — when a book is clicked, its rack section is highlighted on the library map via `highlightRack()`.
